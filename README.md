# Developer databases for fortune
This repo tries to recover several quotes related with development world.

The quotes have to be splited by the '%' character.

The route used by fortune in a linux system is:
> /usr/share/games/fortunes/

To generate the databases for the program fortune you should execute the command
> ~$: sudo strfile <filename>

and then move the generated *.dat files to the fortune databases route
